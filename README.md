# 🍎 Apple iPhone 15 Pro Website Clone

A high-fidelity clone of the official Apple iPhone 15 Pro landing page, built from scratch using **React**, **GSAP**, and a custom **3D model created in Blender**.

> ⚙️ All logic, animations, and 3D elements were created by me — no templates or libraries were used for animations or models. A true end-to-end clone built with care.

💬 About the Project
This project was built as a personal challenge to test my creative and technical skills:

Replicating Apple’s precise design language

Creating Blender 3D assets

Writing GSAP logic manually without any boilerplate

Ensuring performance, accessibility, and responsive behavior

📌 Future Improvements
Add prefers-reduced-motion support for accessibility

Lazy-load video assets based on scroll position

Replace heavy video with compressed Lottie or 3D WebGL for better performance

🛠️ Every line of code and animation logic is written by me from scratch — no code or templates were copied.
I closely studied the original Apple site and recreated the UI and animation behavior in my own way using React and GSAP.
