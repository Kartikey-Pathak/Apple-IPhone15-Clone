# 🍎 Apple iPhone 15 Pro Website Clone

A high-fidelity clone of the official Apple iPhone 15 Pro landing page, built from scratch using **React**, **GSAP**, and a custom **3D model created in Blender**.

> ⚙️ All logic, animations, and 3D elements were created by me — no templates or libraries were used for animations or models. A true end-to-end clone built with care.
